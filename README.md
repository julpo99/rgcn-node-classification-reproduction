# rgcn-node-classification-reproduction

### Instruction to replicate the experiments:

#### 1. Clone the repository

#### 2. Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the notebook `rgcn_aifb.ipynb` to train the baseline model on the AIFB dataset.

#### 4. Run the notebook `rgcn_aifb_attention.ipynb` to train the model with attention mechanism on the AIFB dataset.

(Running the notebook with the attention mechanism takes high computational resources and time)
